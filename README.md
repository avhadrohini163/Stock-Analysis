# Stock-Analysis
This is the one for VBA module
## Overview of Project:
	This project gives the overall stocks total daily volume and percentage returns of all stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018.
## Analysis:
### Stock Analysis for Year 2017:
	The images of the stock analysis excel sheet and timer for the year 2017 is given below:

	The returns of the stocks for the year 2017 are given in column 3. Most of the returns acquired by the “DQ” and “SEDG” stocks about 199.4% and 184.5% respectively.
	Almost all stocks received positive returns except the “TERP” stock which is -7.2%.
	Refactored code ran for 0.265625 seconds. Without refactoring the code ran for 1.296875 seconds. 
### Stock Analysis for Year 2018:
	The images of the stock analysis excel sheet and timer for the year 2018 is given below:
![All Stocks 2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92752935/141660351-f0c8f7a3-5533-47e6-9807-ade1e3e737a6.png)

	The returns of the stocks for the year 2018 are given in column 3. Most of the returns acquired by the “DQ” and “RUN” stocks about 81.9% and 84.0% respectively. All other stocks return were running in negatives.
	It was safe to say that “DQ” stock performed well both years and it was safe to invest in this stock.
	Refactored code ran for 0.2929688 seconds. Without refactoring the code ran for 1.195313 seconds. 
##Summary:
	In summary the “DQ” and “Run” stocks performed well in case of returns. According to analysis one can figure that it is safevto invest in both stocks.
	According to both analyses for the year 2017 and 2018 it is evident that refactored code was much faster than the code which wasn’t refactored.
	However refactored code was more complex than the one which wasn’t refactored.
